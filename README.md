### **What is Coin Master?**

Coin Master is a mobile game developed by Moon Active, where players spin a virtual slot machine to earn coins, attack other players' villages, raid their resources, and build their own villages. The primary goal of the game is to progress through various stages by collecting cards, building new structures for your village, and leveling up. 

One of the most exciting features of Coin Master is the slot machine. Every spin provides a chance to win coins, attack or raid other players' villages, earn shields, or unlock free spins and chests. 

However, to progress efficiently in the game, **spins** are essential. Spins are the currency you use to make those critical slot machine spins. Unfortunately, getting enough spins to advance quickly can sometimes feel like a challenge.
